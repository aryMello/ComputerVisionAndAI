# Exploring AI and Computer Vision: A Learning Journey

### Courses:

#### 1. Artificial Intelligence A-Z
- Lunar Lander (DQN):
   - This code implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to train an agent to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment from the Gymnasium library. The goal of the agent is to learn to control the lander and land it safely on the surface. It uses a neural network to estimate the Q-values for state-action pairs, which are updated using Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique.
